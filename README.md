This bundle implements simple user registration, login and password change and recovery in Symfony2 projects.

It is meant to have the same features as the FOSUserBundle but with an opinionated domain driven design, using CQRS command bus architecture.

See [hmlb/DDD](https://github.com/hmlb/ddd) for details about domain driven design implementation and  [hmlb/DDD-bundle](https://github.com/hmlb/ddd-bundle) for its integration with symfony 2 and doctrine ORM/ODM.


This library is used in production applications but is still under development and is not yet clearly documented.
